# Jam With Me

It is a social media website focused on music, musicians and
instruments. Place where you can find a person to play along
with, create profile, post your own content, follow users or chat
with them (thanks to messenger-like chat application). You are
able to add more users to conversation or to remove them.
There are a couple of search bars to help you find interesting
posts, profiles or users to chat with. There is also tag filtering
and pagination. You can rate or comment other users posts.
Project contains REST API, features like live notifications and
many more.
Chat was most challenging feature to code. That is because
this part of project has to run asynchronously. I had to use
Django Channels with JavaScript WebSockets. It also uses
Redis database.
